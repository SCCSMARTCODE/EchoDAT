Verse 1: <br>In the shadows of doubt, I used to reside, <br>Afraid to spread my wings, afraid to take the ride. <br>But now I'm breaking free, I'm leaving it all behind, <br>I'll chase the boundless dreams that I've always had in mind. <br> <br>Pre-Chorus: <br>With every step I take, uncertainty will fade, <br>I'll find my strength within, and let my fears cascade. <br>I'm soaring through the clouds, my spirit knows no bounds, <br>In these uncharted skies, my destiny is found. <br> <br>Chorus: <br>Oh, I'll fly high, higher than ever before, <br>Through uncharted skies, I'll explore. <br>There's a world out there, waiting for me, <br>I'll seize the moment, and set myself free. <br> <br>Verse 2: <br>No more second-guessing, no more holding back, <br>I'll navigate the stars, on my chosen track. <br>With courage as my guide, I'll chart my own course, <br>In this vast universe, I'll discover my true source. <br> <br>Pre-Chorus: <br>With every step I take, uncertainty will fade, <br>I'll find my strength within, and let my fears cascade. <br>I'm soaring through the clouds, my spirit knows no bounds, <br>In these uncharted skies, my destiny is found. <br> <br>Chorus: <br>Oh, I'll fly high, higher than ever before, <br>Through uncharted skies, I'll explore. <br>There's a world out there, waiting for me, <br>I'll seize the moment, and set myself free. <br> <br>Bridge: <br>I'll embrace the challenges, I'll face the unknown, <br>With hope as my compass, I'll never be alone. <br>The winds of change will guide me, to where I'm meant to be, <br>In these uncharted skies, my spirit will be free. <br> <br>Chorus: <br>Oh, I'll fly high, higher than ever before, <br>Through uncharted skies, I'll explore. <br>There's a world out there, waiting for me, <br>I'll seize the moment, and set myself free. <br> <br>Outro: <br>In these uncharted skies, my dreams will come alive, <br>I'll soar beyond the limits, with passion as my drive. <br>With every note I sing, with every beat I play, <br>Uncharted skies, I'll forever chase away.
